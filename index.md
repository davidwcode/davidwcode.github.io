## Coding

Here are my current favorite things about programming (in order):


1. Environment issues
2. Bugs
3. Assembly

On the topic of coding, here's a snippet of the most advanced piece of code I have written. Do not feel ashamed if you are unable to comprehend its higher purpose:
```python
def swap(a, b):
    a, b = b, a
    return a, b

a, b = swap(a, b)
```
Just kidding. That was a joke, if you couldn't tell. Here's an actual linked project [sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHgt8giw1LY).
